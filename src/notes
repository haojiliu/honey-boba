dribbble:
1, amateur works are deranked to the bottom or not showing up at all.
2. no constructive feedbacks, all compliments
3. no categorization of logo, poster, water color, hand lettering, murals, etc.

my app need to make sure:
1. aiming for students, and amateurs, not professional/good designers
1. amateur/bad designs are not under-represented, they should show up
2. at least half of the comments are constructive feedbacks, not just claps or thumbs ups
3. once you receive enough feedback and are good enough, then you switch to dribbble.

4. make a fun gaming system, where if you reach certain threshold, i give you a badge saying "finally ready for dribbble!!!"
5. mechanism to discourage meaningless thumbups or upvotes, not-so-helpful comments

watching top-notch designs doesn't equal being able to create good designs
a design critique platform should be for more than just top notch designs receiving congrats and most of the eyeballs.
